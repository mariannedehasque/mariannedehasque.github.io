## About Me:

My name is **Marianne Dehasque** and I am an evolutionary biologist interested in understanding how evolutionary and demographic processes shape an organism's genome. My research involves analyzing time-series data from historical and/or ancient samples. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University, studying the genomics of feralization in sheep.
