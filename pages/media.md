                            <em>The Strange DNA of the last mammoths</em> (2024)<br />
                            <p>10,000 years ago the last mammoths to walk the earth were trapped on Wrangel island, northern Siberia. New genetic insights reveals, how many were trapped, how their population grew and perhaps even how they became extinct. 
                                <br> Stefan Milo made an entertaining and informative video about our genomic work on the last woolly mammoth population. Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf1HWjUJPZM</p>
