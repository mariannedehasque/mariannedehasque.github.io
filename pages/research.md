## Research:

My research focuses on how evolutionary and demographic forces shape an organism's genome. I combine population genomics, conservation genomics, and palaeogenomics to investigate evolutionary processes through time and space.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:2px;">Genomics of feralization</h3>
Domestication of plants and animals has been a major event in the history of humans, marking the turning point from a hunter-gatherer to a sedentary lifestyle. Not only does the study of domesticates provide crucial insights into human history, but the drastic morphological and genetic changes associated with domestication offer a valuable framework to study evolutionary processes over a short time-scale. Sheep (Ovis aries) were domesticated around 10-12 thousand years ago and spread from their native range in the Fertile Crescent into Europe, and eventually the rest of the world, through multiple domestication and expansion waves. The free-roaming sheep native to Cyprus, Corsica, and Sardinia were introduced on the islands by humans over seven thousand years ago and are thought to represent the feral remnants of the earliest domesticated sheep. The long-term survival of these feral sheep indicates that these populations successfully adapted to the islands, providing  the opportunity to study the genomic effects of rapidly changing selective pressures - from wild to tame to wild again - in parallel systems.

In this project, I am analyzing modern and ancient DNA from woolly and non-woolly sheep, herded, feral, and wild, to better understand the genomics of feralization. More specifically, I am exploring the demographic history of feral sheep and investigating the genomic signatures of selection as well as introgression between feral, wild, and domestic sheep lineages.
